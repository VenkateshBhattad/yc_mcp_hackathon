This is test5.txt, created to test the final Python implementation of the Google Drive MCP server.

With our refined and simplified implementation, we can now:
- Upload files to Google Drive
- Create folders with custom organization
- Share files with collaborators
- Manage file permissions

This test file was created on May 17, 2025 for the final demonstration.
